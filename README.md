NumPy provides a wide range of data types, or dtypes, for storing and manipulating data efficiently. These data types allow NumPy to handle different kinds of numeric, boolean, and even object-based data. NumPy’s data types are more specific than Python’s built-in types, enabling better performance and memory management, especially for numerical computations.
<br>
Here’s a detailed explanation of the common data types in NumPy:
<br>
1. Integer Types<br>
NumPy has several integer types, which vary by the amount of memory they use. The type names specify the number of bits allocated for the integer (e.g., int8 uses 8 bits, int32 uses 32 bits, etc.).
<br>
Signed integers:<br>

int8: 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127)<br>

int16: 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767)<br>

int32: 32-bit signed integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)<br>

int64: 64-bit signed integer (very large range)<br>

Unsigned integers:<br>


uint8: 8-bit unsigned integer (0 to 255)<br>

uint16: 16-bit unsigned integer (0 to 65,535)<br>

uint32: 32-bit unsigned integer (0 to 4,294,967,295)<br>

uint64: 64-bit unsigned integer (very large range)<br>

2. Floating-Point Types<br>
These types store numbers with decimal points, represented using floating-point notation. Like integers, different types allocate different amounts of memory.
<br>
float16: Half precision (16-bit)<br>
float32: Single precision (32-bit, most common for general purposes)<br>
float64: Double precision (64-bit, more precise, but uses more memory)<br>

Example:<br>

python<br>
Copy code<br>
import numpy as np<br>
arr = np.array([1.2, 3.5], dtype=np.float32)<br>
print(arr.dtype)  # Output: float32<br>

3. Complex Types<br>
NumPy also supports complex numbers, which have both real and imaginary parts. The precision is determined by the size of the floating-point numbers for the real and imaginary parts.<br>

complex64: Complex number with two 32-bit floats (real and imaginary parts)<br>
complex128: Complex number with two 64-bit floats<br>
Example:<br>

python<br>
Copy code<br>
arr = np.array([1+2j, 3+4j], dtype=np.complex128)<br>
print(arr.dtype)  # Output: complex128<br>
4. Boolean Type<br>
The boolean type (bool_) represents data as True or False values, where True is stored as 1, and False as 0.<br>

bool_: Boolean type that stores True or False.<br>
Example:
<br>
python<br>
Copy code<br>
arr = np.array([True, False, True], dtype=np.bool_)<br>
print(arr.dtype)  # Output: bool<br>
5. String (Text) Types<br>
NumPy can store text data using fixed-length strings, which are of type string_ or unicode_.<br>

string_: Fixed-length ASCII string type (e.g., S10 for a string of length 10).<br>
unicode_: Fixed-length Unicode string type (e.g., U10 for a Unicode string of length 10).<br>
Example:<br>

python<br>
Copy code<br>
arr = np.array(['hello', 'numpy'], dtype=np.string_)<br>
print(arr.dtype)  # Output: |S5<br>
6. Object Type<br>
The object type can store any Python object. This type is less efficient and should be used only when necessary, such as when you need arrays that can store mixed data types.<br>
<br>
object_: Used to store Python objects.<br>
Example:<br>

python<br>
Copy code<br>
arr = np.array([1, 'numpy', [1, 2]], dtype=np.object_)<br>
print(arr.dtype)  # Output: object<br>
7. Datetime and Timedelta Types<br>
NumPy has special data types for dealing with date and time. These are highly optimized for operations like comparing, sorting, and performing arithmetic on dates and times.<br>

datetime64: Stores date and time information, such as year, month, day, hour, minute, etc.<br>
timedelta64: Stores differences in time (time intervals).<br>
Example:<br>

python<br>
Copy code<br>
date_arr = np.array(['2021-01-01', '2021-02-01'], dtype=np.datetime64)<br>
print(date_arr.dtype)  # Output: datetime64<br>
8. Void Type<br>
The void type is used for arbitrary memory chunks and is rarely used in typical numerical computations. It is mainly used for custom data structures or record arrays.<br>
